## Discussion Questions

1. How is Breadth-first Search different in graphs than in trees? Describe the differences in your own words.

(Your answer goes here)
with graphs, there could be a lot more nodes to be visited on each layer

2. What is one application of Breadth-first Search (besides social networks)? Describe how BFS is used for that application. If you need some ideas, check out [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-breadth-first-traversal/?ref=rp).

(Your answer goes here)
breadth first search is good for finding pathfinding, like google maps, where finding the shortest path is important, because breadth first will always find the closest possible target
